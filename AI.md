- GenAI: Generative AI encompasses a broader range of models capable of generating various types of content beyond
- while LLM specifically refers to a subset of generative AI models focusing on language tasks.
- What is generative AI?

  - gen AI models are like conversational programs that can generate content based on the inputs supplied.
  - Gen AI models learn the patterns and structure from input training data and then create new data with similar characteristics.
  - exploring large language models, which are a highly sophisticated computer programs trained on gigantic amounts of data that can be text or images.
  - Large language models refer to large, general-purpose language models that can be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes.
  - Parameters are the memories and knowledge that the machine has learned during model training.
  - When you submit a prompt to an LLM, it calculates the probability of the correct answer from its pre-trained model. The probability is determined through a task called pre-training. Pre-training an LLM involves feeding a massive dataset of text, images, and code to the model so that it can learn the underlying structure and patterns of the language.

  - Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect.
  - This happens because LLMs can only understand the information they were trained on.
  - they often assume that the prompt is true. Hallucinations can be caused by a number of factors, including: The model is not trained on enough data.
